          <p>Spare a thought for Mumford & Sons. Yes, they’ve sold millions of records. And yes, they’ve been deemed credible enough to play with artists such as Bob Dylan and Paul Simon. But whatever they do, it seems this folk-rock four-piece will forever be a lightning rod for critical vitriol.

            That they are inauthentic was the original source of irritation when these public schoolboys from London emerged almost a decade ago, all tweed waistcoats, neckerchiefs and hoedowns. “They look like f***ing Amish people,” Liam Gallagher famously said. Yet the band were dismissed, too, when they finally dropped the faux-rusticana and swapped the banjo-driven bonhomie for pastoral American rock on their 2015 album, Wilder Mind. This drift towards a War on Drugs-like sound, the critics argued, was hardly the big gamble Mumford & Sons claimed, given how massive their following is in the US.

            For Delta, their fourth album, the band have thrown every musical idea they possess into the mix: some orchestral flourishes here, some dabs of jazz and electronica there, with the acoustic instruments that dominated Sigh No More and Babel here drenched in digital effects by producer Paul Epworth (Adele, Coldplay). Texturally, Delta thrums with weird stuff, weaving in keyboard filigrees between the soaring riffs. Where Wilder Mind purported to be ambitious, this record genuinely is. The soundscapes are cinematic – and intense.</p>
